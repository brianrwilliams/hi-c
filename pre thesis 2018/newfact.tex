\brian{Define factorization algebra. I suggest we use the notation $\UU(\cAd(P))$ and $\UU_\alpha(\cAd(P))$.}

\subsection{The shifted Poisson structure}

Every associative algebra determines a Lie algebra via the commutator. 
There is a left adjoint to this forgetful functor given by the enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra. 
Given a Lie algebra $\fg$, this enveloping algebra $U \fg$ can also be thought of as a quantization of a certain Poisson algebra.
The Poincar\'{e}--Birkoff--Witt theorem says that the associated graded ${\rm Gr} \; U \fg$ by the filtration given by symmetric degree is precisely $\CC[\fg^*]$.
It is a classical fact that the linear dual $\fg^*$ of a Lie algebra has the structure of a Poisson manifold. 
The Poisson bracket on $\CC[\fg^*] = \Sym(\fg)$ is defined by extending the Lie bracket on the quadratic functions by the Leibniz rule. 

In a completely analogous way, the factorization enveloping algebra of a local Lie algebra has a ``classical limit" given by a $P_0$ factorization algebra. 
Recall, the factorization enveloping algebra of a local Lie algebra $\sL$ evaluated on an open set $U$ is given by the Chevalley--Eilenberg complex of the compactly supported sections on $U$
\ben
\clieu_*(\sL(U)) = \left(\Sym^*(\sL(U)[1]), \d_\sL + \d_{CE}\right) .
\een
There is a filtration of this complex defined by $F^k = \Sym^{\geq k} (\sL (U)[1])$. 
Moreover, this defines a filtration of the factorization algebra $\UU(\sL)$. 

\begin{lem} Let $\sL$ be a local Lie algebra. 
Then, the associated graded factorization algebra ${\rm Gr} \; \UU(\sL)$ has the structure of a $P_0$ factorization algebra. 
Similarly, if $\alpha \in \cloc^*(\sL)$ is a cocycle of cohomological degree one then ${\rm Gr} \; \UU_\alpha(\sL)$ has the structure of a $P_0$ factorization algebra.
\end{lem}

Up to issues of functional analysis, one should think of the $P_0$ algebra ${\rm Gr} \; \UU(\sL)$ as the algebra of functions on the sheaf of dg vector spaces $\sL^\vee [-1]$ with differential induced from that on $\sL$. 
The $P_0$ algebra ${\rm Gr} \; \UU_\alpha(\sL)$ is equal to functions on the same sheaf of dg vector spaces but with bracket modified by $\alpha$. 

\begin{cor} For any principal $G$-bundle $P \to X$ consider the associated graded factorization algebra
\ben
{\rm Gr} \; \UU (\cAd(P)) = \left(\Sym^*(\cAd(P)[1]), \dbar \right) .
\een
Then, an element $\alpha \in H^1_{\rm loc}(\cAd(P))$ determines the structure of a $P_0$ factorization algebra on ${\rm Gr} \; \UU (\cAd(P))$. 
\end{cor}

In the case that $\alpha = J(\theta)$ is the local cocycle corresponding to a symmetric polynomial $\theta \in \Sym^{d+1}(\fg^*)^\fg$ the Poisson structure can be described explicitly as follows. 
The Poisson tensor is of the form $\Pi = \Pi_{[-,-]} + \Pi_\alpha $ where 
\ben
\Pi_{[-,-]} = \wedge \tensor [-,-] : \left(\Omega^{d,*}_X \tensor \fg \right) \tensor \left(\Omega^{0,*}_X \tensor \fg\right) \to \Omega^{d,*}_X \tensor \fg 
\een 
and
\ben
\Pi_{\alpha} : \left(\Omega^{0,*}_X \tensor \fg\right)^{\tensor d} \to \Omega^{d,*}_X\tensor \fg
\een
sends $\alpha_1 \tensor \cdots \tensor \alpha_d \mapsto \partial \alpha_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \partial \alpha_d$. 

\subsubsection{BV quantization}

The factorization envelope $\UU \sL$ is a particular quantization of the $P_0$ factorization algebra of functions on $\sL^\vee [-1]$.

\subsection{The algebra on a sphere}

\subsection{The factorization algebra on a disk}.

We now consider the value of the factorization algebra on the complex $d$-disk $D^d \subset \CC^d$. 
We note that the factorization algebra is translation invariant, so for disks of fixed radius, the value will be independent of where the disk is centered. 
Moreover, we will find that there is a (dense) subspace of the value of the factorization algebra on the disk that is also independent of the {\em radius} of the disk. 
It is this subspace that we will refer to as the ``state space" of the higher dimensional Kac--Moody algebra. 

A translation invariant factorization algebra $\sF$ on $\CC^d$ has an action of the real $2d$-dimensional vector space spanned by the constant vector fields
\ben
\left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial z_1}, \ldots, \frac{\partial}{\partial z_d}, \frac{\partial}{\partial \zbar_1}, \ldots, \frac{\partial}{\partial \zbar_d}\right\} .
\een  
In particular, this means that each vector field acts by a derivation on $\sF(U)$ for any $U \subset \CC^d$. 
For a precise definition of a (smoothly) translation invariant factorization algebra see Definition 4.8.1.3 of \cite{CG1}. 

\brian{KM is translation invariant}

\subsubsection{}

For any open $V \subset \CC^d$ the underlying graded vector space of $\UU(\Omega^{0,*}(V) \tensor \fg)$ is
\ben
\Sym^*(\Omega^{0, \#}_c(V) \tensor \fg [1]) .
\een 
For any $q \geq 0$ one has, by Serre duality, an identification
\ben
\Omega^{0,q}_c (V) \cong \left(\Omega^{d, d-q}(V)\right)^\vee .
\een 
At the level of cohomology this is an identification, $H^{d-q}_{\dbar}(V , \Omega^d_{hol}) \to H$ \brian{how to phrase this..}

\begin{lem}\label{lem disk cohomology}Let $D(z,r)$ be the disk centered at $z$ of radius $r$. 
Then, the map induced by Serre duality
\ben
\Sym \left(\left(\d^d z \sO_{hol}(D(z,r)) \tensor \fg^* \right)^\vee [-d+1]\right) \to \UU(\Omega^{0,*}(V) \tensor \fg) 
\een
is a quasi-isomorphism.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Consider the spectral sequence induced by the filtration by symmetric degree on $\UU(\Omega^{0,*}(V) \tensor \fg)$.
The $E_1$ page of this spectral sequence is equal to the cohomology of the complex
\ben
\left(\Sym^*(\Omega^{0, *}_c(D(z,r)) \tensor \fg [1]), \dbar \right) .
\een
The differential is induced from the Lie bracket on $\fg$. 
Since $D(z,r)$ is Stein, we have by \brian{ref} a quasi-isomorphism
\ben
\Omega^{0,*}_c(D(z,r)) \simeq \left(\Omega^d_{hol}(D(z,r)) \right)^\vee [-d]  .
\een
Thus, the $E_1$-page is equal to the symmetric algebra on the graded vector space $\left(\Omega^d_{hol}(D(z,r)) \right)^\vee [-d+1]$. 
The differential is zero for degree reasons, and hence the spectral sequence collapses. 
The result follows using the framing $\Omega^d_{hol}(D(z,r)) = \d^d z \sO_{hol}(D(z,r))$. 
\end{proof}

This lemma says that elements in the cohomology of $\UU(\Omega^{0,*}(D(z,r)) \tensor \fg)$ are described by polynomial functions on the graded vector space $\d^d z \sO_{hol}(D(z,r)) \tensor \fg^* [1]$. 
We will drop the holomorphic volume form factor $\d^d z$ for notational expedience. 
Given $X \in \fg$ and $n_1,\ldots,n_d$ we can define the following {\em linear} functional on $\sO_{hol}(D(z,r))$.
\ben
\begin{array}{cccl}
\Large
X(n_1,\ldots,n_d ; z) : & \sO_{hol}(D(z,r)) \tensor \fg^* & \to & \CC \\
 & f \tensor \xi & \mapsto & \<X, \xi\> \frac{\partial^{n_1}}{\partial z^{n_1}_1} \cdots \frac{\partial^{n_d}}{\partial z_d^{n_d}} f(z) 
\end{array}
\een
where $\<-,-\>$ denotes the evaluation pairing between $\fg$ and $\fg^*$. 
By Lemma \ref{lem disk cohomology} this functional determines an element in the cohomology of the factorization algebra $\UU(\Omega^{0,*} \tensor \fg)$ on the disk $D(z,r)$. 
This element is of cohomological degree $d-1$. 

\brian{-------}
\brian{Higher OPE structure on $\CC^d$.}

There is a rich history of the interaction between factorization algebras and vertex algebras originating from Beilinson and Drinfeld's \cite{BD} pioneering work in the subject of chiral algebras using the language of $D$-modules. 
In \cite{CG1} it is shown how factorization algebras on $\CC$ we work with are directly related to vertex algebras. 
The class of ..

\begin{dfn} A translation invariant factorization algebra $\CC^d$ is {\em holomorphically} translation invariant if, for any $U \subset \CC^d$, there exists degree $-1$ derivations
\ben
\Bar{\eta}_i : \sF(U)\to \sF(U)
\een
for $i = 1,\ldots,d$ such that $[\Bar{\eta}_i, \Bar{\eta}_j] = \left[\Bar{\eta}_i, \frac{\partial}{\partial \zbar_i} \right] = 0$, and 
\ben
[\Bar{\eta}_i, \d_{\sF}] = \frac{\partial}{\partial \zbar_i} .
\een 
as derivations on $\sF$. 
\end{dfn}

This definition says that the derivations given by the anti-holomorphic derivatives act {\em homotopically} trivial with homotopies given by the derivations $\Bar{\eta}_i$. 

\begin{prop} Suppose $\sF$ is a holomorphically translation invariant factorization algebra on $\CC^d$. 
Then, $\sF$ defines a algebra over the colored cooperad $\Omega^{0,*}({\rm Disks}_d)$. 
In particular, for each $r_1,\ldots,r_n, s > 0$ the product maps
\ben
m[p] : \sF(D(0,r_1)) \times \cdots \times \sF(D(0,r_n)) \to \sF(D(0,s))
\een
for $p \in {\rm Disks}(r_1,\ldots,r_n ; s)$ lift to multilinear maps
\ben
\mu^{\dbar} (r_1,\ldots,r_k ; s) : \sF(D(0,r_1)) \times \cdots \times \sF(D(0,r_n)) \to \Omega^{0,*}\left({\rm Disks}(r_1,\ldots, r_n ; s), \sF(D(0,s))\right)
\een
satisfying certain associatively relations. 
\end{prop}


Next, we suppose the holomorphically translation invariant factorization algebra $\sF$ satisfies the following.

\begin{assumption} For any $s < r$ the factorization structure map induced by $D(0,s) \hookrightarrow D(0,r)$ 
\ben
\sF(D(0,r)) \to \sF(D(0,s))
\een 
is an injection at the level of cohomology. 
\end{assumption}

This is a rather weak assumption and is often satisfied in practice. 
For instance, if $\sF$ is built as the factorization enveloping algebra of the Dolbeault complex of a holomorphic vector bundle the above holds. 

\begin{prop} 
Let $\sF$ be a holomorphically translation invariant factorization algebra on $\CC^d$, where $d > 1$.
Furthermore, suppose Assumption \ref{inclusion of disks} is satisfied, and set $V_\sF = {\rm colim}_{r} H^*\sF(D(0,r))$.
Then, the factorization product of two disjoint disks inside of a larger disk determines a commutative product 
\ben
\mu : V_{\sF} \tensor V_{\sF} \to V_{\sF}
\een
and a $z$-dependent bilinear map
\ben
\{-,-\}_{z} : V_{\sF} \tensor V_{\sF} \to V_{\sF} \tensor z_1^{-1}\cdots z_d^{-1} \CC[z_1^{-1},\ldots, z_d^{-1}] .
\een
\end{prop}




\begin{prop} 
Let $X,Y \in \fg$ and $\{n_i\}, \{m_j\}$ be collections of non-negative integers where $i,j = 1,\ldots,d$. 
For any $z \in \CC^d$ one has
\ben
\begin{array}{ccc}
\{X(n_1,\ldots,n_d; 0), Y(m_1,\ldots,m_d; z)\}_z & \sim & [X,Y] \frac{1}{(n_1 + m_1 - 2)! \cdots (n_d + m_d - 2)!} \partial_{z_1}^{n_1 + m_1 - 2} \cdots \partial_{z_d}^{n_1+m_1-2} \frac{1}{z_1 \cdots z_d} \\
& + & ??? \cdots 
\end{array}
\een
\end{prop}
