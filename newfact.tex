\subsection{The shifted Poisson structure}

Every associative algebra determines a Lie algebra via the commutator. 
There is a left adjoint to this forgetful functor given by the enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra. 
Given a Lie algebra $\fg$, this enveloping algebra $U \fg$ can also be thought of as a quantization of a certain Poisson algebra.
The Poincar\'{e}--Birkoff--Witt theorem says that the associated graded ${\rm Gr} \; U \fg$ by the filtration given by symmetric degree is precisely $\CC[\fg^*]$.
It is a classical fact that the linear dual $\fg^*$ of a Lie algebra has the structure of a Poisson manifold. 
The Poisson bracket on $\CC[\fg^*] = \Sym(\fg)$ is defined by extending the Lie bracket on the quadratic functions by the Leibniz rule. 

In a completely analogous way, the factorization enveloping algebra of a local Lie algebra has a ``classical limit" given by a $P_0$ factorization algebra. 
Recall, the factorization enveloping algebra of $\sL$ evaluated on an open set $U$ is given by the Chevalley--Eilenberg complex
\ben
\clieu_*(\sL_c(U)) = \left(\Sym^*(\sL_c(U)[1]), \d_\sL + \d_{CE}\right) .
\een
There is a filtration of this complex defined by $F^k = \Sym^{\geq k} (\sL_c(U)[1])$. 
Moreover, this defines a filtration of the factorization algebra $\UU(\sL)$. 

\begin{lem} Let $\sL$ be a local Lie algebra. 
Then, the associated graded factorization algebra ${\rm Gr} \; \UU(\sL)$ has the structure of a $P_0$ factorization algebra. 
Similarly, if $\alpha \in \cloc^*(\sL)$ is a cocycle of cohomological degree one then ${\rm Gr} \; \UU_\alpha(\sL)$ has the structure of a $P_0$ factorization algebra.
\end{lem}

Up to issues of functional analysis, one should think of the $P_0$ algebra ${\rm Gr} \; \UU(\sL)$ as the algebra of functions on the sheaf of dg vector spaces $\sL^\vee [-1]$ with differential induced from that on $\sL$. 
The $P_0$ algebra ${\rm Gr} \; \UU_\alpha(\sL)$ is equal to functions on the same sheaf of dg vector spaces but with bracket modified by $\alpha$. 

\begin{cor} For any principal $G$-bundle $P \to X$ consider the associated graded factorization algebra
\ben
{\rm Gr} \; \UU (\cAd(P)) = \left(\Sym^*(\cAd(P)[1]), \dbar \right) .
\een
Then, every $\alpha \in H^1_{\rm loc}(\cAd(P))$ determines the structure of a $P_0$ factorization algebra on ${\rm Gr} \; \UU (\cAd(P))$. 
\end{cor}

In the case that $\alpha = J(\theta)$ is the local cocycle corresponding to a symmetric polynomial $\theta \in \Sym^{d+1}(\fg^*)^\fg$ the Poisson structure can be described explicitly as follows. 
The Poisson tensor is of the form $\Pi = \Pi_{[-,-]} + \Pi_\alpha $ where 
\ben
\Pi_{[-,-]} = \wedge \tensor [-,-] : \left(\Omega^{d,*}_X \tensor \fg \right) \tensor \left(\Omega^{0,*}_X \tensor \fg\right) \to \Omega^{d,*}_X \tensor \fg 
\een 
and
\ben
\Pi_{\alpha} : \left(\Omega^{0,*}_X \tensor \fg\right)^{\tensor d} \to \Omega^{d,*}_X\tensor \fg
\een
sends $\alpha_1 \tensor \cdots \tensor \alpha_d \mapsto \partial \alpha_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \partial \alpha_d$. 

\subsubsection{BV quantization}

The factorization envelope $\UU \sL$ is a very special quantization of the $P_0$ factorization algebra of functions on $\sL^\vee [-1]$.
