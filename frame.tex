\textcolor{red}{Kevin: This is very incomplete, as I've been distracted by writing up the other projects and focusing on applications. The main goals I want to accomplish in this are: 1) construct the universal Kac-Moody in any dimension, 2) show how to recover the sphere and iterated loop algebras and compare the sphere algebra to Faonte-Hennion-Kapranov, 3) prove a version of GRR over the formal moduli of $G$-bundles by an explicit calculation of the anomaly of higher Kac-Moody acting on beta-gamma with coefficients in a module, 4) present the realization of these higher factorization algebras as the boundary of both 5d and 7d supersymmetric gauge theories. }

\textcolor{red}{I believed I've worked out all of these, and my goal is to have this on the arXiv by the end of October, in time for application decisions.
(I wanted to include a formula for the OPE in general dimensions, but I think I'll just include that in my thesis and wait until I have a better idea of the full higher vertex algebra structure.)}
