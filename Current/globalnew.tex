 \section{Some global aspects of the higher Kac-Moody factorization algebras}

A compelling aspect of factorization algebras is that they are local-to-global objects,
and hence the global sections---the factorization homology---can contain quite interesting information.
For instance, in the case of a one-dimensional locally constant factorization algebra, the global sections along a circle encodes the Hochschild homology of the corresponding associative algebra. 
In the complex one-dimensional situation, the factorization homology along Riemann surfaces is closely related to the conformal blocks of the associated vertex algebra. 

In the first part of this section, we direct our attention to a class of complex manifolds called {\em Hopf manifolds},
whose underlying smooth manifold has the form $S^1 \times S^{2d-1}$.
One reason for choosing this family of manifolds is that the factorization homology serves as a natural home for characters of representations of the sphere algebra $\Tilde{\fg}_{d,\theta}^\bullet$
In more physical terms, the factorization homology is related to the partition function of $\sG$-equivariant holomorphic field theories, such as the higher dimensional $\beta\gamma$-system.
Indeed, the answer admits a concise description in terms of Hochschild homology, see Proposition \ref{prop: hopf}. 
\brian{more on index/character}

After this, we return to the LMNS variants of the twisted higher Kac-Moody factorization algebra that exist on other closed $d$-folds and assert a relationship to the ordinary Kac-Moody algebra on Riemann surfaces. 

\subsection{Hopf manifolds and twisted indices}

We focus on a family of complex manifolds defined by Hopf \cite{Hopf} which exist in every complex dimension $d$. 
By definition, a Hopf manifold of dimension $d$ is a complex manifold homeomorphic to $S^{2d-1} \times S^1$. 
We will focus on a particular class of Hopf manifolds that admit the following explicit presentation. 

\begin{dfn}
Fix an integer $d \geq 1$. 
Let $q_i \in D(0,1)^{\times}$, $1 \leq i \leq d$, be nonzero complex numbers of modulus $|q_i| <1$. 
The $d$-dimensional {\em Hopf manifold of type} ${\bf q} = (q_1,\ldots,q_d)$ is the following quotient of punctured affine space $\CC^d \setminus \{0\}$ by the infinite cyclic group:
\[
X_{\bf q} = \left. \left(\CC^d \setminus \{0\}\right) \right/ \left( (z_1,\ldots,z_d) \sim (q_1^{2\pi i \ZZ} z_1, \ldots,q_d^{2 \pi i \ZZ} z_d) \right) .
\]
\end{dfn}

We will denote the obvious quotient map by $p_{\bf q} : \CC^d \setminus \{0\} \to X_{\bf q}$. 
It is easy to see that the manifolds we consider are indeed Hopf manifolds, that is, $X_{\bf q} \cong S^{2d-1} \times S^1$ as smooth manifolds.
%Note that $X_{f}$ is compact for any $f$. 

\begin{rmk}
In the case $d=1$, all Hopf surfaces of the type we consider are equivalent to elliptic curves.
For $d>1$, it is an exercise (see Chapter 2 of \cite{KodairaDef}) to show that $X_{\bf q}$ is diffeomorphic to $S^{2d-1} \times S^1$ for any choice of $(q_1,\ldots,q_n)$. 
In particular, when $d > 1$, $H^{2}_{dR} (X_{\bf q}) = 0$.
So, Hopf manifolds are {\em not} K\"{a}hler in complex dimensions bigger than one. 
\end{rmk}

%For any $d$ and tuple $(q_1,\ldots, q_d)$ as above, we see that as a smooth manifold there is a diffeomorphism $X_{\bf q} \cong S^{2d-1} \times S^1$. 
%Indeed, the radial projection map $\CC^d \setminus \{0\} \to \RR_{>0}$ defines a smooth $S^{2d-1}$-fibration over $\RR_{>0}$. 
%Passing to the quotient, we obtain an $S^{2d - 1}$-fibration 
%\[
%X_{\bf q} \to \left. \RR_{>0} \right/ \left(r \sim \lambda^{\ZZ} \cdot r \right) \cong S^1 .
%\]
%Here, $\lambda = (|q_1|^2 + \cdots + |q_d|^2)^{1/2} > 0$. 
%Since there are no non-trivial $S^{2d-1}$ fibrations over $S^1$ we obtain $X_{\bf q} = S^{2d-1} \times S^1$ as smooth manifolds. 

For any choice of ${\bf q} = (q_1,\ldots,q_d)$, we have the local Lie algebra $\sG_{X_{\bf q}} = \Omega^{0,*}(X_{\bf q}, \fg)$, and the corresponding Kac-Moody factorization algebra obtained by the enveloping factorization algebra $\UU(\sG_{X_{\bf q}})$.
A choice of invariant polynomial $\theta \in \Sym^{d+1}(\fg^*)^\fg$ defines a $\CC[K]$-linear twisted factorization enveloping algebra $\UU_{\theta}(\sG_{X_{\bf q}})$.  
Our first result is a computation of the global sections of this factorization algebra.  

\begin{prop}
\label{prop: hopf}
Let $X_{\bf q}$ be a Hopf manifold and suppose $\theta \in \Sym^{d+1}(\fg^*)^\fg$ is any $\fg$-invariant polynomial of degree $(d+1)$. 
Then, there is a quasi-isomorphism of $\CC[K]$-modules
\[
\int_{X_{\bf q}} \UU_\theta (\sG_{X_{\bf q}}) \xto{\simeq} \Hoch_*(U \fg)[K] .
\]
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Write $X = X_{\bf q}$. 
We first consider the untwisted case, $\theta = 0$, where the statement reduces to $\int_X \UU (\sG_X) \simeq \Hoch_*(U \fg)$.
The factorization homology on the left hand side is computed by
\[
\int_X \UU(\sG_X) = \clieu_*(\Omega^{0,*}(X) \tensor \fg) .
\]
Our goal is to compute the Lie algebra homology of the dg Lie algebra $\Omega^{0,*}(X) \tensor \fg$.  

There is an explicit model for the Dolbeault cohomology of the Hopf manifold $X$ that we will appeal to. 
In Example 4.63 of \cite{Tanre}, it is shown that there is a isomorphism of bigraded vector spaces
\beqn\label{hopfiso}
H^*\left(\Omega^{*,*}(X), \dbar\right) \cong \CC[\epsilon,\delta]
\eeqn
where $\epsilon$ has bidegree $(0,1)$ and $\delta$ has bidegree $(d,d-1)$. 

\begin{rmk}
The basic idea of this isomorphism is that $X$ can be realized as the total space of a holomorphic principal $T^2 = S^1 \times S^1$- bundle over $\CC P^{d-1}$. 
Topologically, this fibration is the product of the Hopf fibration with the circle. 
The model we cited comes from studying the Borel spectral sequence for this holomorphic principal bundle.
\end{rmk}

We fix a quasi-isomorphism at the cochain level by considering the orthogonal projection onto the harmonic forms. 
Let $\Delta_{\dbar} = [\dbar,\dbar^*]$ and denote by $\sH^{*,*}_{\dbar}(X)$ the bigraded vector space of forms annihilated by $\Delta_{\dbar}$. 
Then, by the isomorphism (\ref{hopfiso}) we see that orthogonal projection determines a quasi-isomorphism
\beqn\label{hopfquasi}
\pi_{\sH}^{0,*} : \left(\Omega^{0,*}(X), \dbar \right) \xto{\simeq} \sH^{0,*}_{\dbar}(X) \cong \CC[\epsilon]
\eeqn
where $\epsilon$ has degree $+1$. 

%Here, we view $\CC[\epsilon,\delta]$ as a cochain complex with zero differential. 

\begin{eg}
When ${\bf q} = (q,\ldots,q)$ where $|q| < 1$, we can write down an explicit Dolbeault representative for $\epsilon$. 
%In fact, we have written down a preferred presentation for the cohomology ring of $X$ given by $H^{0,*}(X) = \CC[\delta]$ where $|\delta| = 1$.
Consider the following $(0,1)$-form on $\CC^d \setminus \{0\}$
\[
\dbar (\log |z|^2) = \sum_i \frac{z_i\d \zbar_i}{|z|^2} .
\]
This $(0,1)$ form is $\ZZ$-invariant, and hence descends along the map $p_{\bf q} : \CC^d \setminus 0 \to X$ to define a $(0,1)$-form on $X$ that is, up to a scalar factor, a representative for $\epsilon$. 
\end{eg}

Applying Chevalley-Eilenberg chains, we obtain the following quasi-isomorphism for the global sections of the untwisted Kac-Moody factorization algebra:
\beqn\label{hopfquasi3}
\begin{tikzcd}
\displaystyle \int_X \UU(\sG_X) = \clieu_*(\Omega^{0,*}(X , \fg)) \ar[r,"\pi^{0,*}_{\sH}", "\simeq"'] &\clieu_*(\CC[\epsilon] \tensor \fg) .
\end{tikzcd}
\eeqn
Now, we can express $\clieu_*(\CC[\epsilon] \tensor \fg) = \clieu_*(\fg \oplus \fg[-1]) = \clieu_*(\fg, \Sym (\fg^{ad}))$, where $\Sym(\fg^{ad})$ is the symmetric product of the adjoint representation of $\fg$. 
By Poincar\'{e}-Birkoff-Witt there is an isomorphism of vector spaces $\Sym(\fg) = U \fg$, so we can write this as $\clieu_*(\fg, U \fg^{ad})$.

Any $U(\fg)$-bimodule $M$ is automatically a module for the Lie algebra $\fg$ by the formula $x \cdot m = xm - mx$ where $x \in \fg$ and $m \in M$.
Moreover, for any such bimodule there is a quasi-isomorphism of cochain complexes 
\[
\clieu_*(\fg, M) \xto{\simeq} {\rm Hoch}_*(U\fg, M) 
\]
which is induced from the inclusion of $\fg \hookrightarrow U \fg$. 
See, for instance, Theorem 3.3.2 of \cite{LodayCyclic}.
Applied to the bimodule $M = U\fg$ itself we obtain a quasi-isomorphism 

\noindent$\clieu_*(\fg , U\fg^{ad}) \xto{\simeq} {\rm Hoch}(U\fg)$.
The right hand side is defined as the Hochschild homology of $U\fg$ with values in $U\fg$ equipped with the standard bimodule structure. 
Composing with the quasi-isomorphism (\ref{hopfquasi3}) we obtain a quasi-isomorphism $\int_X \UU(\sG_X) \xto{\simeq} \Hoch(U\fg)$ as desired.

The twisted case is similar. 
Let $\theta$ be a nontrivial degree $(d+1)$ invariant polynomial on $\fg$. 
Then, the factorization homology is equal to
\[
\int_X \UU_\theta (\sG_X) = \left(\Sym(\Omega^{0,*}(X) \tensor \fg)[K] , \dbar + \d_{CE} + K \cdot \d_\theta\right) .
\]
Applying our model for the Dolbeault cohomoloogy, we obtain a quasi-isomorphism of the global sections with the cochain complex
\beqn\label{twisted hopf}
\left(\Sym(\fg[\delta])[K] ,  \d_{CE} + K \cdot \d_\theta \right) .
\eeqn
We note that $\d_\theta$ is identically zero on $\Sym(\fg[\delta])$. 
Indeed, for degree reasons, at least one of the inputs must be from $\fg \hookrightarrow \fg[\delta] = \fg \oplus \fg[-1]$, which consists of constant functions on $X$ with values in the Lie algebra $\fg$. 
In the formula for the local cocycle from Proposition \ref{prop j map} associated to $\theta$ it is clear that if any one of the inputs is $\Delta_{\dbar}$-harmonic then the cocycle vanishes identically. 
Indeed, one can integrate by parts to put it in the form $\int \partial \alpha \cdots \partial \alpha$, which is the integral of a total derivative, hence zero since $X$ has no boundary.
Thus (\ref{twisted hopf}) just becomes the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex with values in the trivial module $\CC[K]$. 
By the same argument as in the untwisted case, we conclude that in this case the factorization homology is quasi-isomorphic to $\Hoch_*(U \fg)[K]$, as desired.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Twisted Hochschild homology}
We deduce a consequence of this calculation for the Hochschild homology of the $A_\infty$ algebra $U(\Tilde{\fg}^\bullet_{d,\theta})$.
Let $p_{\bf q} :  \CC^d \setminus \{0\} \to X$ be the quotient map and consider the following diagram
\[
\xymatrix{
\CC^d \setminus \{0\} \ar[r]^-{p_{\bf q}} \ar[d]^-{r} & X \ar[d]^{\Bar{r}} \\
\RR_{>0} \ar[r]^-{\Bar{p}_{\bf q}} & S^1
}
\]
Here, $r$ is the radial projection map and $\Bar{r}$ is the induced map on the quotient.
The action of $\ZZ$ on $\CC^d \setminus\{0\}$ gives $\sG_{\CC^d \setminus \{0\}}$ the structure of a $\ZZ$-equivariant factorization algebra. 
In turn, this determines an action of $\ZZ$ on pushforward factorization algebra $r_* \sG_{\CC^d \setminus \{0\}}$.
We have seen that there is a dense locally constant subfactorization algebra on $\RR_{>0}$ of the pushforward factorization algebra that is equivalent as an $A_\infty$ algebra to $U(\Tilde{\fg}^\bullet_{d,\theta})$.
A consequence of excision for factorization homology, see Lemma 3.18 \cite{AFTopMan}, implies that there is a quasi-isomorphism
\[
\Hoch_*(U(\Tilde{\fg}^\bullet_{d,\theta}), {\bf q}) \simeq \int_{S^1} \Bar{r}_* \UU_\alpha(\sG_X),
\]
The left-hand side is the Hochschild homology of the $A_\infty$ algebra $U \Tilde{\fg}_{d,\theta}^\bullet$ with coefficients in the bimodule $U \Tilde{\fg}_{d, \theta}^\bullet$ with the ordinary left-module structure and right-module structure given by twisting the ordinary action by the automorphism corresponding to the element $1 \in \ZZ$ on the algebra.

Now, since the factorization homology computes the global sections of the factorization algebra we have a quasi-isomorphism
\[
\int_{S^1} \Bar{\rho}_* \UU_\alpha(\sG_X) \xto{\simeq} \int_X \UU_{\alpha} (\sG_X) .
\]
It follows that there is a quasi-isomorphism of Hochschild homologies
\beqn\label{hoch1}
\Hoch_*(U(\Tilde{\fg}^\bullet_{d,\theta}), {\bf q}) \simeq \Hoch_* (U\fg)[K] .
\eeqn
Peculiarly, this statement is purely algebraic as the dependence on the manifold for which the Kac-Moody factorization algebra lives has dropped out.

\subsection{Coupling to a free theory}

\def\Cl{{\rm Cl}}

We now study a class of free theories on Hopf manifolds that have a symmetry by the local Lie algebra $\sG_X$. 
Similarly to Section \ref{sec: qft}, we study this situation by coupling the local Lie algebra $\sG_X$ to the free theory.
Our main result in this section is an interpretation of this coupling at the {\em quantum level} as a certain trace \brian{fix}. 

There are two main differences between the theory we consider here and the one we considered in Section \ref{sec: qft}.
First, in this section we are working on a closed $d$-fold, namely the Hopf surface $X = X_{\bf q}$. 
Although there is still a factorization algebra of observables on $X$, the main statement we extract in this section deals with the global sections of this factorization algebra.
The theory actually makes sense on any complex manifold, but the result we state at the end of this section Proposition \ref{??} is specific to the case of a Hopf manifold. 

Secondly, the theory we consider here is a free theory of {\em fermions}. 
Thus, we will work with super vector spaces and super cochain complexes.

\begin{rmk}
As a matter of convention, if $V$ is a super vector space we denote by $\Pi(V)$ the super vector space obtained by reversing the parity. 
\end{rmk}

\subsubsection{The free $bc$ system}

To define the theory, we again start with a $\fg$-module $V$.
The theory is very similar in spirit to what is known as the $bc$ system in conformal field theory (which is usually considered in the context of the gauging the bosonic string). 
Hence, we borrow the terminology. 

\begin{dfn}
The {\em classical $bc$ system} valued in the super vector space $W$ on a complex manifold $X$ has space of fields
\[
\sE_{bc} (X) = \Omega^{0,*}(X , W) \oplus \Omega^{d,*}(X , W)[d-1],
\]
with the linear BRST operator given by $Q = \dbar$.
We will write fields as pairs $(c,b)$. 
There is a $(-1)$-shifted symplectic pairing is given by integration along $X$ combined with the evaluation pairing between $W$ and its dual: 
\[
\<c, b\> = \int_X \<c, b\>_{W}.
\] 
The action functional for this free theory is thus
\[
S_{bc} (c,b) = \int_X \<c, \dbar b\>_{W} .
\]
\end{dfn}

\begin{rmk}
%Note that the complex fields of this theory is a super cochain complex concentrated in completely odd super degree. 
Note that this theory is completely similar to the definition of the higher $\beta\gamma$ system given in Section \ref{sec: qft}. 
The only difference is that we allow for values in a super vector space $W$, as opposed to an ordinary (bosonic) one. 
When $d=1$ this theory is the usual $bc$ system (valued in $W$) from conformal field theory.
\end{rmk}

Before moving on to studying $\sG_X$-equivariance, we characterize the global observables of the $bc$ system with values in $W$ evaluated on Hopf manifolds. 
To state the result we introduce the following definition whose bosonic version is familiar. 

\begin{dfn}
Suppose $W$ is a super vector space and consider $W \oplus W^*$ as an abelian super Lie algebra. 
Define the central extension of super Lie algebras
\[
\CC \cdot \hbar \to {\rm Heis}_\hbar (W \oplus W^*) \to W \oplus W^*
\]
given by the $2$-cocycle defined by the natural pairing between $W$ and its dual. 
The $\hbar$-dependent {\em Weyl algebra} associated to $W$ is
\[
\Weyl_\hbar(W \oplus W^*) = U({\rm Heis}_\hbar(W \oplus W^*)) .
\]
\end{dfn}

\begin{rmk}
When $W = V$ is purely bosonic this recovers the usual ($\hbar$-dependent) Weyl algebra of $V \oplus V^*$. 
When $W = \Pi(V)$ is purely fermionic, $\Weyl_\hbar(\Pi(V) \oplus \Pi(V^*))$ is the ($\hbar$-dependent) Clifford algebra of $V\oplus V^*$ associated to the obvious quadratic form.  
\end{rmk} 

\begin{lem}\label{lem: hopfcliff}
Let $X$ be a Hopf manifold and consider the observables of the higher $bc$ system on $X$ valued in the super vector space $W$. 
There is a natural quasi-isomorphism
\[
\Obs^q_{bc}(X) \xto{\simeq} {\rm Hoch}_*(\Weyl_\hbar(W \oplus W^*)) .
\]
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}

The observables of any free BV theory can be modeled as the Lie algebra chains of a certain dg Lie algebra. 
For the higher $bc$ system valued in $W$, the dg Lie algebra is a (shifted) central extension of the form
\[
\CC \cdot \hbar [-1] \to \Hat{\sL} \to \sL
\]
where
\[
\sL = \Omega^{d,*}(X, W^*)[d-1] \oplus \Omega^{0,*}(X, W)
\]
is an abelian dg Lie algebra and the cocycle defining the extension is
\[
\sL \times \sL \to \CC \cdot \hbar [-1] \;\; , \;\; (\gamma, \beta) \mapsto \hbar \int_X \<\gamma, \beta\>_W .
\] 
Note that this cocycle always has even parity in the $\ZZ/2$ grading.  
As a cochain complex $\Hat{\sL} = \sL \oplus \CC\cdot \hbar [-1]$. 

We can identify this dg Lie algebra with a smaller dg Lie algebra.
The quaso-isomorphism (\ref{hopfquasi}) determines a quasi-isomorphism of dg Lie algebras
\begin{align}\label{hopfquasi2}
\Hat{\sL} \xto{\simeq} & \delta \CC[\epsilon] \tensor W^* [d-1] \oplus \CC[\epsilon] \tensor W \oplus \CC \cdot \hbar [-1] \\ & = (W^* \oplus W) [\epsilon] \oplus \CC \cdot \hbar [-1] .
\end{align}
In the second equality, we recall that $\delta$ is of degree $d-1$ and $\epsilon$ is of degree $+1$.
The only nonzero bracket for the dg Lie algebra on the right hand side is of the form
\[
[f(\epsilon) \tensor w^* , g(\epsilon) \tensor w] = \<w^*, w\> \int_{\epsilon} f (\epsilon) g(\epsilon) \d \epsilon
\]
where $\int_{\epsilon} \d \epsilon$ denotes Berezin integration. 

A standard result about free BV theories asserts a quasi-isomorphism
\[
\Obs^{\q}_{bc} (X) \xto{\simeq} \clieu_*(\Hat{\sL}) .
\] 
Applying chains to the quasi-isomorphism (\ref{hopfquasi2}) and post-composing, we obtain a quasi-isomorphism
\[
\Obs^\q_{bc} (X) \xto{\simeq} \clieu_*(\Weyl_\hbar((W^* \oplus W) [\epsilon])) .
\] 
The lemma now follows from the HKR quasi-isomorphism. 
\end{proof}

We are most interested in the case that $W = \Pi(V)$, where $V$ is an ordinary (bosonic) vector space. 
In this case, the lemma implies that there is a quasi-isomorphism
\[
\Obs^q_{bc}(X) \xto{\simeq} {\rm Hoch}_*(\Cl_\hbar(V \oplus V^*)) 
\]
where $\Cl_\hbar(V \oplus V^*)$ denotes the $\hbar$-dependent Clifford algebra. 
In this, case there is a slick description of the Hochschild homology. 

If we choose a basis $\{v_i\}$ of $V$, and dual basis $\{v_i^*\}$ of $V^*$, then there is a homomorphism 
\[
\int_{Ber} : {\rm Hoch}_* (\Cl (V \oplus V^*)) \to \CC 
\]
determined by picking off the coefficient of the element $v_1 \cdots v_{\dim(V)} v_1^* \cdots v^*_{\dim(V)}$ in the Hochschild complex. 
In other words, this is precisely the Berezin integral that projects onto the ``top fermion". 

It is a standard fact that the Clifford algebra is Morita trivial \brian{ref}, so that ${\rm Hoch}_*(\Cl(V \oplus V^*)) \simeq {\rm Hoch}_* (\CC) \cong \CC$.
Hence, $\int_{Ber}$ is a quasi-isomorphism. 

After inverting $\hbar$, invoking Lemma \ref{lem: hopfcliff} we obtain a composition of quasi-isomorphisms 
\[
\Obs^\q_{bc} (X) [\hbar^{-1}] \xto{\simeq} {\rm Hoch}_*(\Cl_\hbar (V \oplus V^*)) \xto{\simeq}\CC[\hbar,\hbar^{-1}] .
\]

Thus, $\fc(X)$ must be a 
\[
H^*(\Obs^{\q}_{eq}(X_{\bf q})) \xto{e^{I^\q / \hbar}} H^*_{\rm Lie}(\sG(X_{\bf q})) \tensor H^*(\Obs^\q_{bc} (X_{\bf q})) \xto{\cong} H^*(\fg, \Sym(\fg^*)) ((\hbar))
\]

\subsubsection{A remark on the anomaly}

Just like in the flat case in Section \ref{sec: qft}, we study the $\sG_X$-equivariant quantization of the $bc$ system when $X$ is a Hopf manifold.
Since the $bc$ system is {\em free} a quantization always exists, and the anomaly $\Theta_X$ to solving the $\sG_X$-equivariant QME parametrizes the central extension of $\sG_X$ that acts on the quantum theory. 
That is, analogously to the flat case, we know that there exists a $\Theta_X \in \hbar H^1_{\rm loc}(\sG_X)[[\hbar]]$ and a quantum Noether map
\[
J^\q : \UU_{\Theta_X} (\sG_X) \to \Obs^{\q}_{bc}(X) .
\] 

Let's consider a more general situation.
Fix a $\fg$-module $V$.
For {\em any} complex $d$-fold $X$, we can consider the higher $bc$ system on $X$ with values in $\Pi(V)$. 

We can represent the anomaly $\Theta_X$ as a local functional of the form
\[
\int_X \fc(X) \wedge \Tilde{\fj}(\alpha)
\]
where $\fc(X) \in \Omega^*(X)$ and $\Tilde{\fj}$ is a functional of the form
\[
\Tilde{\fj} : \Sym(\sG_X[1]) \to \Omega^*(X) .
\]

To summarize, we have argued that the local class representing the extension of $\sG_X$ acting on the quantization of the $bc$ system on any Hopf manifold must be of a multiple of $\fj_X(\ch_{d+1}^\fg(V))$. 

\subsection{The Kac-Moody vertex algebra and compactification} 

We turn briefly to the variant of the Kac-Moody factorization algebra associated to the cocycles from Section ~\ref{sec: nekext}.
This class of cocycles is related to the ordinary Kac-Moody vertex algebra on Riemann surfaces through dimensional reduction, as we will now show. 

Consider the complex manifold $X = \Sigma \times \PP^{d-1}$ where $\Sigma$ is a Riemann surface and $\PP^{d-1}$ is $(d-1)$-dimensional complex projective space.
Suppose that $\omega \in \Omega^{d-1,d-1}(\PP^{d-1})$ is the natural volume form, this clearly satisfies the conditions of Lemma \ref{lem: cocycle KM} and so determines a degree one cocycle $\phi_{\kappa, \omega} \in \cloc^*(\sG_{\Sigma \times \PP^{d-1}})$ where $\kappa$ is some $\fg$-invariant bilinear form $\kappa : \fg \times \fg \to \CC$. 
We can then consider the twisted enveloping factorization algebra of $\sG_{\Sigma \times \PP^{d-1}}$ by the cocycle $\phi_{\kappa, \omega}$. 

Recall that if $p : X \to Y$ and $\sF$ is a factorization algebra on $X$, then the pushforward $p_* \sF$ on $Y$ is defined on opens by $p_* \sF : U \subset Y \mapsto \sF(p^{-1} U)$. 

\begin{prop}
Let $\pi : \Sigma \times \PP^{d-1} \to \Sigma$ be the projection. 
Then, there is a quasi-isomorphism between the following two factorization algebras on $\Sigma$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\pi_* \UU_{\phi_{\kappa, \theta}} \left(\sG_{\Sigma \times \PP^{d-1}}\right)$, the pushforward along $\pi$ of the Kac-Moody factorization algebra on $\Sigma \times \PP^{d-1}$ of type $\phi_{\kappa,\omega}$;
\item $\UU_{{\rm vol}(\omega) \kappa} (\sG_\Sigma)$, the Kac-Moody factorization algebra on $\Sigma$ associated to the invariant pairing ${\rm vol}(\omega) \cdot \kappa$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

The twisted enveloping factorization on the right-hand side is the familiar Kac-Moody factorization alegbra on Riemann surfaces associated to a multiple of the pairing $\kappa$.
The twisting ${\rm vol}(\omega) \kappa$ corresponds to a cocycle of the type in the previous section 
\[
J({\rm vol}(\omega) \kappa) = {\rm vol}(\omega) \int_\Sigma \kappa(\alpha, \partial \beta)
\]
where ${\rm vol}(\omega) = \int_{\PP^{d-1}} \omega$. 

\begin{proof}
Suppose that $U \subset \Sigma$ is open. 
Then, the factorization algebra $\pi_* \UU_{\phi_{\kappa, \theta}} \left(\sG_{\Sigma \times \PP^{d-1}}\right)$ assigns to $U$ the cochain complex
\beqn\label{KMPn}
\left(\Sym \left(\Omega^{0,*} (U \times \PP^{d-1})\right)[1] [K], \dbar + K \phi_{\kappa, \omega}|_{U \times \PP^{d-1}} \right),
\eeqn
where $\phi_{\kappa, \omega}|_{U \times \PP^{d-1}}$ is the restriction of the cocycle to the open set $U \times \PP^{d-1}$. 
Since projective space is Dolbeault formal its Dolbeault complex is quasi-isomorphic to its cohomology.
Thus, we have
\[
\Omega^{0,*} (U \times \PP^{d-1}) = \Omega^{0,*}(U) \tensor \Omega^{0,*}(\PP^{d-1}) \simeq \Omega^{0,*}(U) \tensor H^*(\PP^{d-1}, \sO) \cong \Omega^{0,*}(U) .
\]
Under this quasi-isomorphism, the restricted cocycle has the form
\[
\phi_{\kappa,\omega}|_{U \times \PP^{d-1}} (\alpha \tensor 1, \beta \tensor 1) = \int_{U} \kappa(\alpha, \partial \beta) \int_{\PP^{n-1}} \omega 
\]
where $\alpha,\beta \in \Omega^{0,*} (U)$ and $1$ denotes the unit constant function on $\PP^{d-1}$. 
This is precisely the value of the local functional ${\rm vol}(\omega) J_\Sigma (\kappa)$ on the open set $U \subset \Sigma$. 
Thus, the cochain complex (\ref{KMPn}) is quasi-isomorphic to 
\beqn
\left(\Sym \left(\Omega^{0,*} (U) \right)[1] [K], \dbar + K {\rm vol}(\omega) J_\Sigma (\kappa) \right) .
\eeqn
We recognize this as the value of the Kac-Moody factorization algebra on $\Sigma$ of type ${\rm vol}(\omega) J_\Sigma (\kappa)$.
It is immediate to see that identifications above are natural with respect to maps of opens, so that the factorization structure maps are the desired ones. 
This completes the proof.
\end{proof}

Now, suppose $\Sigma_1,\Sigma_2$ are Riemann surfaces and let $\omega_1,\omega_2$ be the K\"{a}hler forms. 
Then, we can consider the two projections
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
& \Sigma_1 \times \Sigma_2 \arrow[dl,"\pi_1"'] \arrow[dr,"\pi_2"] & \\
\Sigma_1 & & \Sigma_2

Consider the following closed $(1,1)$ form $\omega = \pi_1^* \omega_1 + \pi_2^* \omega_2 \in \Omega^{1,1}(\Sigma_1 \times \Sigma_2)$. 
According to the proposition above, for any symmetric invariant pairing $\kappa \in \Sym^2 (\fg^*)^\fg$ this form determines a bilinear local functional
\[
\phi_{\kappa,\omega}(\alpha) = \int_{\Sigma_1 \times \Sigma_2} \omega \wedge \kappa(\alpha, \partial \alpha) 
\]
on the local Lie algebra $\sG_{\Sigma_1\times \Sigma_2}$.
A similar calculation as in the previous example implies that the pushforward factorization algebra $\pi_{i*}\UU_{\phi_{\kappa, \omega}}\sG$, $i=1,2$, is isomorphic to the two-dimensional Kac-Moody factorization algebra on the Riemann surface $\Sigma_i$ with level equal to the Euler characteristic $\chi(\Sigma_j)$, where $j \ne i$. 
This result was alluded to in the work of Johansen in \cite{JohansenKM} where he showed that there exists a copy of the Kac-Moody chiral algebra inside the operators of a twist of the $\cN=1$ supersymmetric multiplet (both the gauge and matter multiplets, in fact) on the K\"{a}hler manifold $\Sigma_1 \times \Sigma_2$. 
In the Section \ref{sec: qft} we saw how the $d = 2$ Kac-Moody factorization algebra embeds inside the operators of a free holomorphic theory on a complex surface. 
This holomorphic theory, the $\beta\gamma$ system, is the minimal twist of the $\cN=1$ chiral multiplet.
Thus, we obtain an enhancement of Johansen's result to a two-dimensional current algebra.
